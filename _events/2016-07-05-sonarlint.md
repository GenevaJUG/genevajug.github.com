On my left: @Duarte, coding in IntelliJ

On my right: @Tamas, coding in Visual Studio

@Duarte and @Tamas will do some live coding in parallel with their favourites IDEs and languages: Java, C# and a little bit of JavaScript. 

Driven by the bugs and code smells found on the fly by SonarLint, they'll initiate a dialog to compare some capabilities and weaknesses of their languages/IDEs, hopefully with not too much of dishonesty ...
