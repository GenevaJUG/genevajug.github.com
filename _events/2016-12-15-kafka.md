As the utility of processing heterogeneous data reaches an increasing number of sectors and businesses, the need to get faster insights and avoid large batch cycles is growing as well.

This talk will first outline what the key concepts of big-data and how stream processing fits into this picture. We will then show-case a reference architecture for building stream processing pipelines and walk through how to implement real-time billing from resource events in a distributed system.
