Sacha was born in Neuch√¢tel, Switzerland and graduated in 1999 from EPFL. It was during Sacha's studies in 1996 that he started his first consulting business - Cogito Informatique. 

In 2001, he joined Marc Fleury's JBoss project as a core contributor and implemented JBoss' original clustering features. 

In 2003, Sacha founded the European headquarters for JBoss and, as GM for Europe, led the strategy and partnerships that helped fuel the company's growth in that region. While in this position, he led the recruitment of some of JBoss' key talent and acquisition of key technology. 

In 2005, he was appointed CTO of JBoss, Inc. and as such, oversaw all of the JBoss engineering activities. 

In June 2006, JBoss, Inc. was acquired by Red Hat (NYSE:RHT). After the acquisition, Sacha remained JBoss CTO and played a crucial role in integrating and productizing JBoss software with Red Hat offerings. In 2007, Sacha became co-General Manager of Red Hat's middleware division. He ultimately left Red Hat in April 2009. 

Following a period of research, Sacha became convinced that public cloud infrastructure would lead a fundamental IT paradigm shift and that middleware would play a key role in that shift. As a result CloudBees, Inc. was formed in April 2010.
