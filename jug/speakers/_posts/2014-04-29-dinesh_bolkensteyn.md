Having fun writing the tools to analyze your code (Java, C#, ...) and the code you wish didn't exist (COBOL, PL/I, RPG, ...) at SonarSource. 

Contributed the support of Java 7 to both PMD and Checkstyle open source projects. 

Prior to that, I had the chance to learn from the best at EPFL, Switzerland.
