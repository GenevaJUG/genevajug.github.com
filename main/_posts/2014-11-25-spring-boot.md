***Hepia, Room A 106, starting at 18h30***

**From Zero To Hero with Spring Boot** by **[Stéphane Nicoll](/jug/speakers.html?key=stephane_nicoll)** (english talk)

Spring Boot, the new convention-over-configuration centric framework from the Spring team at Pivotal, marries Spring's flexibility with conventional, common sense defaults to make application development not just fly, but pleasant! 

Ideal for microservices and for all your distributed systems and devops needs. 

Join Spring Boot committer Stéphane Nicoll for a look at what Spring Boot is, why it's turning heads, why you should consider it for your next application (REST, web, batch, big-data, integration, whatever!) and how to get started.

As usual, we will end this meetup with a buffet provided by our lovely sponsors !
