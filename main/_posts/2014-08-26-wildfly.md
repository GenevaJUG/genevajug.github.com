It contains robust implementations of WebSocket, Batch, JSON, Concurrency, JMS2, JAX-RS 2, CDI 1.1, and all Java EE 7 technologies. 

Undertow is the new cutting-edge web server in WildFly 8 and is designed for maximum throughput and scalability, including environments with over a million connections. The number of ports is reduced used by multiplexing protocols over HTTP using HTTP Upgrade.

This presentation will provide an overview of all these features and many others such as domain mode, RBAC, etc.
