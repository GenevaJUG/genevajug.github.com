I am a Principal Software Engineer and System Analyst at Swissquote based in Gland, Switzerland. 
My responsibilities include coordinating the cross-team and cross-departmental efforts as well as participating in building a system that fits both business and technical needs. 
In addition, I am also a deeply passionate eco-optimist who is certified in GreenIT. 
As a responsible and eco-conscious IT professional, I try to encourage my colleagues at work to remain aware of the environmental impact of IT and to integrate good practices into their daily routines.
