Olivier Lange is the founder and managing-director of Le Petit Atelier de Génie logiciel, a software consultancy helping teams to accelerate their development processes and evolve legacy systems.


We provide advisory, business analysis and do craft ad hoc software — we build full-fledged apps, mostly business intelligence or data lineage monitoring dashboards,  fill functional gaps and move complex datasets between systems.


Over the course of 18 years, we realized 130 assignments, ranging from 3 days to 24 months, for small and medium businesses, private and public institutions in Switzerland, France and Luxembourg— such as Lombard Odier TBI & Asset Management, Radio Television Suisse-romande (RTS), Office fédéral des routes (OFROU), HEI, Pro Helvetia, University of Geneva.


Next to our assignments, we run weekly and yearly code retreats, to step aside and take time, to research, learn and practice advanced subjects and pioneering technologies. We're currently focusing on reactive data flows, graph databases and visualizations of complex linked-data structures and multi-layered graphs.
