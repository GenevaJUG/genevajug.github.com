I was born with keyboard and monitor at hand. In the last years I have cultivated a strong passion in Java development, recently joined by C and ASM development on x86 / PowerPC platforms. A big fan of the DDD (Domain Driven Design) world, I have developed several Event-Sourced (and CQRS) high performance solutions in the medical and IoT field. I am an active member of various online communities on performance (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mechanical-sympathy) and Senior Software Engineer for Red Hat in the messaging field, specialized in performance-oriented development and testing.
