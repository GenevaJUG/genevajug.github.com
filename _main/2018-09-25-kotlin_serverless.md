title: "25th of September, Kotlin and serverless"
---

***Fintech Fusion, starting at 18h30***

**Kotlin and serverless** with **[Nicolas Fränkel](/jug/speakers.html?key=nicolas_frankel)** and **[David Delabassée](/jug/speakers.html?key=david_delabassee)** (english talk)

Kotlin has unarguably gained a lot of attention in the last few years—not only in the Java ecosystem. Some even say it’s a silver bullet. 

On the other hand, serverless computing and FaaS are the new black, as they radically change how software is organized, deployed, and charged for, and are in the process of further disrupting the always-evolving world of cloud computing. 

This fast-paced hands-on session introduces you to Kotlin and serverless. It then shows you live what this winning combo can offer.

As usual this presentation will be followed by a buffet offered by our sponsors
