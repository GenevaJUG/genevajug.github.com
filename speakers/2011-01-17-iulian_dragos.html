	<h3>Iulian Dragos</h3>
	<br/>
	
    <p>Iulian Dragos is a key member of Martin Odersky’s EPFL’s Scala team. For the last six years he has been the main contributor for many critical Scala components including the compiler backend, its optimizer and the Eclipse build manager.</p>

<p>Iulian has been responsible for many of the innovations that give Scala a better run time performance. His most recent contribution, seen in Scala 2.8, is the ability to apply specialization to generic libraries to give a major performance improvement for primitive types. As well as his development work, Iulian has spent several years teaching Scala, compilers and type systems, both at introductory and advanced levels.</p>
