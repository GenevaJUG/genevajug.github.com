    <h2>July 5, IntelliJ versus Visual Studio, let's compete with help of SonarLint</h2>
    <h3>avec <a href="speakers.html?key=duarte_meneses">Duarte Meneses</a>
     et <a href="speakers.html?key=tamas_vajk">Tamas Vajk</a></h3>
    
    <br>

    
    <p>On my left: @Duarte, coding in IntelliJ</p>

<p>On my right: @Tamas, coding in Visual Studio</p>

<p>@Duarte and @Tamas will do some live coding in parallel with their favourites IDEs and languages: Java, C# and a little bit of JavaScript.</p>

<p>Driven by the bugs and code smells found on the fly by SonarLint, they’ll initiate a dialog to compare some capabilities and weaknesses of their languages/IDEs, hopefully with not too much of dishonesty …</p>
