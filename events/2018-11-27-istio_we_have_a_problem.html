<p>Istio, we have a problem! We've just deployed a shinny new set of micro-services and it behaves in a strange manner. Hard to say why with so many moving parts...</p>

<p>Let's leverage the newly installed service mesh to understand what we've deployed, find the root problem, fix it with a bandaid and then do a proper, non trivial, blue-green deployment of a v2.</p>

<p>That will involve the Service Graph, Prometheus monitoring, Grafana Dashboards, Traffic mirroring, all orchestrated in a simple manner by Istio.</p>
