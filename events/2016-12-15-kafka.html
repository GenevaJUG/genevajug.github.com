    <p>As the utility of processing heterogeneous data reaches an increasing number of sectors and businesses, the need to get faster insights and avoid large batch cycles is growing as well.</p>

<p>This talk will first outline what the key concepts of big-data and how stream processing fits into this picture. We will then show-case a reference architecture for building stream processing pipelines and walk through how to implement real-time billing from resource events in a distributed system.</p>
