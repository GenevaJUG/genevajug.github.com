GenevaJUG will welcome **Freddy Mallet** 

Abstract: 

Pull requests are the backbone of the devops infrastructure across many companies in the industry.
However, they are fast becoming the #1 bottleneck in engineering teams negatively impacting the throughput, stability and culture of the teams. 
Fluid pull requests are an extension of pull requests with principles from trunk-based development. 
In this talk, I will show the current problems with pull requests and how fluid pull requests solve them.
