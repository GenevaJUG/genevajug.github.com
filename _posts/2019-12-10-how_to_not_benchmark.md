Francesco Nigro will present two subjects during this JUG session :

**How to NOT do benchmarking**

Doing benchmarking right isn't easy: anything can just gone wrong with the many optimisations that a modern JVM can do. What makes things even more complex is that using new tools (like JMH) won't help but to have a sharper razor to be cut with: learning by (negative) examples what to NOT do while benchmarking is an entertaining and useful way to learn how to do them right.

**Just Qs**

Concurrent queues are almost everywhere: they are the building block of many well-known libraries and widely adopted frameworks.
Although most people assume them to be a "solved problem" is fascinating to see how much recent are the most interesting improvements on them.
