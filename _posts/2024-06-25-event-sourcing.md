GenevaJUG will welcome **Nicolas Piguet** 

Event sourcing is an increasingly common way to build applications. This approach comes with its own set of problems: 
How do I ensure that my data remains consistent in case of errors? 
How can I safely apply events to my data store in a concurrent, redundant environment? 
How can I do all this without locking resources or introducing middleware that destroys my performance?
